# Hemp

Small JavaScript string builder.

```
npm install hemp
```

## Examples

```javascript
var Hemp = require('hemp');

// Hemp is used to make strings (from smaller strings).
var spin = Hemp();

// It creates a function that accumulates other strings.
spin('The');

// The function can take any number of strings.
spin(' quick', ' brown ');

// The function also returns itself, for chaining.
spin
  ('fox jumps ')
  ('over the lazy ')
  ('dog.');

// To obtain the accumulated string, call toString.
console.log(spin.toString());

// Or just call the function again.
console.log(spin());

// The function will turn anything into a string, including another Hemp.
var more = Hemp()('Now ', 'you ', 'know.');
spin(' ', more);

// Hemp can automatically add separators
var words = Hemp(' ')('One', 'Two', 'Three');
words(); // One Two Three Four Five Six

// As well as prefixes.
var spell = Hemp('-', 'Hemp is spelled ')('h', 'e', 'm', 'p');
spell(); // Hemp is spelled h-e-m-p

// And suffixes too!
var query = Hemp(' ', 'SELECT * ', ';')
  ('FROM table')
  ('WHERE column IS NOT NULL')
  ('LIMIT 1');
query(); // SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1;
```
